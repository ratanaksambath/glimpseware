# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database
# with its default values.  The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed
# (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#
# loads environment-specific seeds. The assumed directory structure in db/ is like this:
# |___seeds
# | |___all.rb
# | |___development.rb
# | |___staging.rb
# | |___production.rb
# |___seeds.rb

# clear some schema caches and column information.

# willfully ignoring Redmine::I18n and it's
# #set_language_if_valid here as it
# would mean to circumvent the default settings
# for valid_languages.
