# Testing OpenProject

OpenProject uses automated tests throughout the stack.

## Frontend tests

To run JavaScript frontend tests, first ensure you have all necessary
dependencies installed via npm (i.e. `npm install`).

You can run all frontend tests with the standard npm command:

    npm test

### Running unit tests with Karma

If you want a single test run, you can use `npm run`:

    npm run karma

By default tests will be run with PhantomJS and Firefox. To start a server or
for more options, such as another browser, invoke the karma executable directly:

    ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start
    ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start --browsers Chrome,Firefox

### Running end-to-end tests with Protractor

If you want to run all tests with Protractor, you can use `npm run`:

    npm run protractor

This is a wrapper around a [Gulp][gulp] task. You can also:

    gulp tests:protractor

The task takes care of:

  * bundling assets using Webpack.
  * running an [Express][express] server that serves the frontend application,
    in addition to mock API endpoints.
  * running a Selenium Webdriver server.

If you want to follow these steps manually for any reason:

1. Ensure you have the the latest Selenium WebDriver:

        npm install -g protractor
        webdriver-manager update

2. You can start the frontend application

        gulp express

3. You can then proceed to start both the Selenium server and Protractor:

        webdriver-manager start
        ./node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor protractor/conf.js


## Rails backend and integration tests

### RSpec

You can run the specs with the following commands:

* `bundle exec rake spec:core` Run all core specs with a random seed
* `bundle exec rake spec:legacy` Run all legacy specs with a random seed
* `bundle exec rake spec:plugins` Run plugin specs with a random seed
* `bundle exec rake spec:all` Run core and plugin specs with a random seed
* `SPEC_OPTS="--seed 12935" bundle exec rake spec` Run the core specs with the seed 12935

### Cucumber [DEPRECATED]

The cucumber features can be run using rake. You can run the following
rake tasks using the command `bundle exec rake <task>`.

* `cucumber` Run core features
* `cucumber:plugins` Run plugin features
* `cucumber:all` Run core and plugin features
* `cucumber:custom[features]`: Run single features or folders of features

    Example: `cucumber:custom[features/issues/issue.feature]`
    * When providing multiple features, the task name and arguments must
      be enclosed in quotation marks.

      Example: `bundle exec rake "cucumber:custom[features/issues features/projects]"`

`cucumber:plugins` and `cucumber:all` accept an optional parameter which
allows specifying custom options to cucumber. This can be used for
executing scenarios by name, e.g. `"cucumber:all[-n 'Adding an issue link']"`.
Like with spaces in `cucumber:custom` arguments, task name and arguments
have to be enclosed in quotation marks.

#### Running cucumber features without rake

Running cucumber features without going through `rake` is possible by using
the following command

`cucumber -r features features/my/path/to/cucumber.feature`

It is also possible to run a certain cuke by passing a line number:

`cucumber -r features features/my/path/to/cucumber.feature:123`

You may also run cukes within a certain folder:

`cucumber -r features features/my/path`

**Note: `-r features` is required otherwise the step definitions cannot be found.**


#### Shortcuts

Here are two bash functions which allow using shorter commands for running
cucumber features:

    # Run OpenProject cucumber features (like arguments to the cucumber command)
    # Example: cuke features/issues/issue.feature
    cuke() { RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake "cucumber:custom[$*]"; }

    # Run OpenProject cucumber scenarios by name
    # Example: cuken Adding an issue link
    cuken() { RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake "cucumber:all[-n '$*']"; }

Setting `RAILS_ENV=test` allows the cucumber rake tasks to run the features
directly in the same process, so this reduces the time until the features are
running a bit (5-10 seconds) due to the Rails environment only being loaded
once.

#### JavaScript and Firebug

To activate selenium as test driver to test javascript on web pages, you can add
@javascript above the scenario like the following example shows:

    @javascript
    Scenario: Testing something with Javascript
      When I ...

You can always start a debugger using the step "And I start debugging".
If you need Firebug and Firepath while debugging a scenario, just replace
@javascript with @firebug.

### Parallel testing

Running tests in parallel makes usage of all available cores of the machine.
Functionality is being provided by [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) gem.

#### Prepare

Adjust `database.yml` to use different databases:

```yml
test: &test
  database: openproject_test<%= ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER'] %>
  # ...
```

Create all databases: `rake parallel:create`

Prepare all databases:

`RAILS_ENV=test parallel_test -e "rake db:drop db:create db:migrate"`

**Note: Until `rake db:schema:load` we have to use the command above. Then we
can use `rake parallel:prepare`**


#### RSpec legacy specs

Run all legacy specs in parallel:

`parallel_test -t rspec -o '-I spec_legacy' spec_legacy`

#### RSpec specs

Run all specs in parallel:

`parallel_test -t rspec spec`

#### Cucumber

Run all cucumber features in parallel:

`parallel_test -t cucumber -o '-r features' features`


## For the fancy programmer

* We are testing on travis-ci. Look there for your pull requests.<br />
  https://travis-ci.org/opf/openproject
* If you have enabled the terminal bell, add `; echo -e "\a"` to the end of your test command. The terminal bell will then tell you when your tests finished.


## Manual acceptance tests

* Sometimes you want to test things manually. Always remember: If you test something more than once, write an automated test for it.
* Assuming you do not have a version of Internet Explorer already installed on your computer, you can grab a VM with preinstalled IE's directly from Microsoft: http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads
