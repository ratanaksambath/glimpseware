== Creating a test ldap database

OpenProject supports using LDAP for user authentications.  To test LDAP
with OpenProject, load the LDAP export from test/fixtures/ldap/test-ldap.ldif
into a testing LDAP server.  Test that the ldap server can be accessed
at 127.0.0.1 on port 389.

Setting up the test ldap server is beyond the scope of this documentation.
The OpenLDAP project provides a simple LDAP implementation that should work
good as a test server.
